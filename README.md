# Churn Prediction using Decision Tree

This repository contains the results and code for a churn prediction model using the Decision Tree algorithm.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict customer churn using a decision tree model. Churn prediction is an important task for businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive measures to retain them. In this project, we trained a decision tree model on churn data and evaluated its performance.

## Results

The performance of the decision tree model on the churn data is as follows:

- Accuracy: 86%
- Recall/Sensitivity: 46%

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `code/`: Directory containing the code for the decision tree model.
- `code/train_decision_tree.py`: Python script to train the decision tree model on the churn data.
- `code/evaluate_decision_tree.py`: Python script to evaluate the performance of the decision tree model.



Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your specific use case.

## Conclusion

The decision tree model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the churn data. However, the recall/sensitivity for identifying churned customers was 46%, indicating that the model could identify approximately 46% of the customers who actually churned. Further analysis and model improvements can be explored to enhance the predictive performance.
